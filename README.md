# nv_vulkan_raytrace

Fork of the Vulkan raytracing tutorial repository provided by Nvidia, available here: https://nvpro-samples.github.io/vk_raytracing_tutorial_KHR/.

A real-time implementation of the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" is provided in the folder `rt_weekend`.
A GPU supporting the Vulkan Ray Tracing extensions is required to run the demos.
